### Hello Everyone âš¡
#### Cyber Security 
I'm Bugra from Istanbul. I am a cyber security engineer at Crypttech. I develop security software with C, C++, Python and JavaScript languages. At the same time, I am working on both a security vulnerability researcher and web penetration tests by working with blue and red teams. I like to solve different questions by participating in various CTF activities. You can ask me any question about cyber security and I will be happy to help.

## Skills and Experience
